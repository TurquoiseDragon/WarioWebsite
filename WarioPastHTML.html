        The first ever appearance of Wario could be attributed to a different character entirely, that being spike, in nintendo's 1985 game Wrecking Crew. <br><br>
            
        Eventually the more modern interpretation of Wario came about in 1992 with Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins where he played the main antognist.<br><br>
            
        Wario was designed to be Mario's foil in nearly every aspect and he retains many of those traits to this day even when he's completely seperate from Mario's adventures!<br><br>
            
            I think anyone will agree the change from spike to Wario was a transformation like no other... He certainly put on weight between those to year!

        After his stint as a antagonist in Super Mario Land 2 and Mario & Wario later in 1993 he got moved into his own games with both Wario Woods and Wario Land in 1994 marking his first steps into the role of the protagonist<br><br>
            
            It was this move into both a platforming and puzzle setting that more than likely influenced his later adventures. by 2003 Wario had 3 Wario Land Games to his name along with a step into the 3D space with Wario World and an entirely new game series with WarioWare!<br><br>
            
            Nintendo was excitingly exploring new ideas with our Yellow scrooge. despite this Wario's Platforming adventures seemed to patter out by the 2010's with Wario Land Shake it! remaining to be his last platforming title.<br><br>
            
            it seemed Wario had moved entirely into his microgame niche leaving his platforming days to the wayside.

        Times have slowed down a lot for our favorite yellow clad anti-hero, mainly appearing in Mario spinoff titles and the ocassional WarioWare title, WarioWare Gold and WarioWare Get It Together! being the most recent, Wario has seemingly only work in the microgame industry<br><br>
            
        Despite this Wario as a platformer has not entierly left the minds of the public as many people remember many of his games fondly. despite not appearing in a title for over a decade independent developers have seeked to create their own titles with games such as Pizza Tower and Anton Blast emulating the slick style of Wario<br><br>
            
            Wario has seemed to left a lasting impression despite his relatively brief time in the limelight!
