        The first ever appearance of Wario could be attributed to a different character entirely, that being spike, in nintendo's 1985 game Wrecking Crew. <br><br>
            
        Eventually the more modern interpretation of Wario came about in 1992 with Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins where he played the main antognist.<br><br>
            
        Wario was designed to be Mario's foil in nearly every aspect and he retains many of those traits to this day even when he's completely seperate from Mario's adventures!<br><br>
            
            I think anyone will agree the change from spike to Wario was a transformation like no other... He certainly put on weight between those to year!
